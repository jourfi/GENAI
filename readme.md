# GPT-2 FINE-TUNING ON MOVIE DATASET - CONDENSED REPORT

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the process of fine-tuning a GPT-2 language model on the wykonos/movies dataset from Hugging Face. The project demonstrates how to adapt a pre-trained language model to generate movie-related content. The implementation uses Google Colab with Python and the Transformers library.

In simple terms, this project takes a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) and teaches it specifically about movies by training it on data from thousands of films. After this specialized training, the model becomes better at understanding and generating movie-related text.

## 2. DATASET & METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Dataset Overview
The "wykonos/movies" dataset from Hugging Face contains approximately 723,000 movie entries with fields including:
- Movie titles
- Overviews/descriptions
- Genres
- Release dates
- Production information
- Popularity metrics

### 2.2 Data Preparation
The implementation provides two methods for loading the dataset:
1. **Direct Upload**: Using Google Colab's file upload functionality
2. **Google Drive**: Accessing the CSV file stored in Google Drive

The preprocessing phase transforms the raw movie data into a format suitable for language model training:
- Converting the pandas DataFrame to a Hugging Face Dataset object
- Creating formatted text strings combining movie titles and overviews
- The formatting template used is: "Movie: {title}\nOverview: {overview}"

### 2.3 Model Configuration
The GPT-2 tokenizer is configured to:
- Convert text to token IDs that the model can process
- Handle padding and truncation consistently
- Set maximum length to 128 tokens per example

The training process is configured with:
- Output directory: "./gpt2-movies-finetuned"
- Training for 2 epochs
- Batch size: 4 examples per device
- Checkpointing every 200 steps
- Mixed precision training (FP16) for GPU acceleration

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION

### 3.1 Code Structure
The implementation follows a logical step-by-step process:

1. **Environment Setup**: Installing necessary libraries
2. **Data Import**: Loading the movie dataset
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Formatting examples for language modeling
4. **Model Initialization**: Loading the pre-trained GPT-2 model
5. **Tokenization**: Converting text to token IDs
6. **Training Setup**: Configuring the training process
7. **Model Training**: Fine-tuning the model on the preprocessed dataset
8. **Model Saving**: Storing the fine-tuned model and tokenizer

### 3.2 Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### Large Dataset Handling
With 723,000 rows, the dataset is substantial. The code includes progress bars and memory-efficient operations to handle this volume of data.

#### Google Colab Limitations
To address Google Colab's time limits and memory constraints, the implementation includes:
- GPU acceleration with FP16 to speed up training
- Efficient checkpoint management to save only the most recent model
- Options for loading data from Google Drive to avoid re-uploading large files

#### Token Limits
To address GPT-2's context window limitations, the implementation:
- Truncates inputs to 128 tokens
- Creates focused examples that prioritize the most relevant movie information

## 4. RESULTS & APPLICATIONS

### 4.1 Training Results
The fine-tuned model is saved to "./gpt2-movies-finetuned" and includes:
- The model weights adapted to movie content
- The configured tokenizer
- Model configuration files

### 4.2 Potential Applications

#### Content Generation
- Generate movie descriptions or summaries
- Create artificial movie concepts
- Extend or elaborate on existing movie ideas

#### Recommendation Systems
With additional development, the model could contribute to:
- Movie recommendation systems
- Content-based filtering mechanisms
- Personalized movie suggestions

#### Text Completion
The model can provide intelligent text completion for:
- Movie review writing assistance
- Content creation for movie databases
- Creative writing in the film domain

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Work

#### Current Limitations
- The model is trained on text data only and lacks visual understanding
- Training epochs are limited to 2 due to computational constraints
- The maximum sequence length of 128 tokens limits the complexity of generated content

#### Future Improvements
- Incorporate multimodal training with movie poster images
- Extend training time and dataset size
- Experiment with larger model variants (medium, large)
- Add evaluation metrics for generated content quality
- Implement a demonstration interface for model testing

## 5. CONCLUSION

This project successfully demonstrates how to fine-tune a GPT-2 language model on a large movie dataset. The implementation provides a flexible approach to data loading and processing while managing computational resources effectively. The resulting model has potential applications in content generation, creative writing, and as a component in larger recommendation systems.
